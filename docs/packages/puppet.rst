puppet - Puppet Manifests (deprecated)
======================================

Note: This package type hasn't been maintained since 2012 and generates puppet
manifests that target Puppet 2.4 or 3.x.

Supported Uses in FPM
---------------------

fpm supports using ``puppet`` only as an output type. This means you can create ``puppet`` packages from input types like ``deb``, ``dir``, or ``npm``

puppet-specific command line flags

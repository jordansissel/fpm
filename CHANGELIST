    Ritschard)

0.4.23 (November 26, 2012)
  - The --directories flag is now recursive when the output package is rpm.
    This makes all directories under a given path as owned by the package

  - Escape '%' characters in file names (#266, #222. Patch by John Wittkoski)

0.4.18 (September 25, 2012)
  - Fix regression in rpm building where the epoch in was missing in the rpm,
    but prior fpm versions defaulted it to 1. This caused rpms built with newer
    fpms to appear "older" than older rpms. Tests added to ensure this regression
    is caught prior to future releases! (Reported by eliklein)

  - deb: add --deb-priority flag (#232) for setting the debian 'priority'
    value for your package.
  - add --template-value. Used to expose arbitrary values to script templates.
    If you do --template-value hello=world, in your template you can do
    <%= hello %> to get 'world' to show up in your maintainer scripts.
  - python: add --python-install-data flag to set the --install-data option to
    setup.py (#255, patch by Thomas Meson)

0.4.14 (August 24, 2012)
  - rpm: Replace newlines with space in any license setting. (#252)

    jimbrowne)
  - dir: don't try to set utime on symlinks (#234, #240, patch by ctgswallow)
  - rpm: relocatable rpms now supported when using the '--prefix' flag.
    Example: fpm -s dir -t rpm --prefix /usr/local -n example /etc/motd 
    (patch by jkoppe)
  - deb: --deb-compression flag: Support different compression methods. 
    Default continues to be gzip.
  - new flag: --template-scripts. This lets you write script templates for
    --after-install, etc. Templates are ERB, so you can do things like 
    '<%= name %>' to get the package name in the script, etc.
  - warn on command invocations that appear to have stray flags to try and
    help users who have complex command lines that are failling.

    patch by Sven Fischer)
  - Allow setting default user/group for files in rpm packages (#208, patch by
    Jason Rogers). Note: This adds --user and --group flags to effect this.
    These flags may go away in the future, but if they do, they will be

    Scheinblum)

  - make --deb-custom-control to work again (Tor Arne Vestb√∏)
  - Add --rpm-digest flag to allow selection of the rpm 'file name' digest
    algorithm. Default is 'md5' since it works on the most rpm systems.
  - Reimplement old behavior assuming "." as the input when using '-s dir' and
    also setting -C (#187)
  - Set BuildRoot on rpm to work around an rpmbuild bug(?) on CentOS 5 (#191)

  - Set default temporary directory to /tmp 
    (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/174)
  - Improve symlink handling (patch by Aleix Conchillo Flaqu√©, pull/177))
  - Python package support changes (thanks to input by Luke Macken):
    * New flag: --python-install-bin. Sets the location for python package
      scripts (default: /usr/bin)
    * New flag: --python-install-lib. Sets the location for the python
      package to install libs to, default varies by system. Usually something
      like /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
    * Fix up --prefix support
    * Improve staged package installation

0.4.1 (March 19, 2012)
  - Fix fpm so it works in ruby 1.8 again.
    Tests run, and passing:
      rvm 1.8.7,1.9.2,1.9.3 do bundle exec rspec

0.4.0 (March 18, 2012)
  - Complete rewrite of pretty much everything.
    * Otherwise, the 'fpm' command functionality should be the same
    * Please let me know if something broke!
  - Now has an API (see examples/api directory)
  - Also has a proper test suite
  - Updated the rpm spec generator to disable all the ways I've found rpmbuild
    to molest packages. This means that fpm-generated rpms will no longer
    strip libraries, move files around, randomly mutate jar files, etc.
  - Add --license and --vendor settings (via Pieter Loubser)
  - python support: try to name python packages sanely. Some pypi packages
    are literally called 'python-foo' so make sure we generate packages named

  - Added a bunch of tests (yaay)

0.3.8 and earlier: I have not kept this file up to date very well... Sorry :(

0.2.29 (May 20, 2011)
  - Add 'tar' source support. Useful for binary releases to repackage as rpms
    and debs. Example:
      fpm -s tar -t rpm -n firefox -v 4.0.1 \
        --prefix /opt/firefox/4.0.1 firefox-4.0.1.tar.bz2

0.2.28 (May 18, 2011)
  - Use --replaces as "Obsoletes" in rpms.

0.2.27 (May 18, 2011)
  - If present, DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables will be used as
    the default maintainer. Previously the default was simply <$user@$hostname>
    https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/37
  - Add '--replaces' flag for specifying packages replaced by the one you are
    building. This only functions in .deb packages now until I find a suitable
    synonym in RPM.
  - Add --python-bin and --python-easyinstall flags. This lets you choose specific
    python and easy_install tools to use when building. Default is simply
    'python' and 'easy_install' respectively.
  - Add support for ~/.fpmrc - The format of this file is the same as the flags.
    One flag per line. https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/38

      --python-bin=/usr/bin/python2.7
      --python-easyinstall=/usr/bin/easy_install2.7

0.2.26 and earlier
  No changelist tracked. My bad, yo.

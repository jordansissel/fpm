0.4.6 (April 10, 2012)
  - Work around more problems in RPM with respect to file listing (#202)

0.4.5 (April 3, 2012)
  - Fix gem->rpm conversion where the '~>' rubygem version operator (#193,
    patch by antoncohen)
  - Escape filenames RPM install process (permits files with spaces, dollar signs, etc) 
    (#196, reported by pspiertz)

0.4.4 (March 30, 2012)
  - Fix a bug in gem bin_dir handling (Calen Pennington)
  - The --config-files flag should work again (Brian Akins)
  - Fix syntax error when using --deb-pre-depends (Andrew Bennett)
  - Make --exclude work again (#185, #186) (Calen Pennington)
  - Fix file listing so that rpm packages don't declare ownership on / and
    /usr, etc.
  - make --deb-custom-control to work again (Tor Arne Vestbø)
  - Add --rpm-digest flag to allow selection of the rpm 'file name' digest
    algorithm. Default is 'md5' since it works on the most rpm systems.
  - Reimplement old behavior assuming "." as the input when using '-s dir' and
    also setting -C (#187)
  - Set BuildRoot on rpm to work around an rpmbuild bug(?) on CentOS 5 (#191)
  - Add --rpm-compression flag to allow selection of the rpm payload
    compression. Default is 'gzip' since it works on the most rpm systems
  - Specs now pass on ubuntu/32bit systems (found by travis-ci.org's test runner)
  - Improve default values of iteration and epoch (#190)
  - Make FPM::Package#files list only 'leaf' nodes (files, empty directories,
    symlinks, etc).

0.4.3 (March 21, 2012)
  - Fix bug in python packaging when invoked with a relative path to a setup.py
    (Reported by Thomas Meson, https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/pull/180)

0.4.2 (March 21, 2012)
  - Set default temporary directory to /tmp 
    (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/174)
  - Improve symlink handling (patch by Aleix Conchillo Flaqué, pull/177))
  - Python package support changes (thanks to input by Luke Macken):
    * New flag: --python-install-bin. Sets the location for python package
      scripts (default: /usr/bin)
    * New flag: --python-install-lib. Sets the location for the python
      package to install libs to, default varies by system. Usually something
      like /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
    * Fix up --prefix support
    * Improve staged package installation

0.4.1 (March 19, 2012)
  - Fix fpm so it works in ruby 1.8 again.
    Tests run, and passing:
      rvm 1.8.7,1.9.2,1.9.3 do bundle exec rspec

0.4.0 (March 18, 2012)
  - Complete rewrite of pretty much everything.
    * Otherwise, the 'fpm' command functionality should be the same
    * Please let me know if something broke!
  - Now has an API (see examples/api directory)
  - Also has a proper test suite
  - Updated the rpm spec generator to disable all the ways I've found rpmbuild
    to molest packages. This means that fpm-generated rpms will no longer
    strip libraries, move files around, randomly mutate jar files, etc.
  - Add --license and --vendor settings (via Pieter Loubser)
  - python support: try to name python packages sanely. Some pypi packages
    are literally called 'python-foo' so make sure we generate packages named
    'python-foo' and not 'python-python-foo' (via Thomas Meson)
  - rpm support: Add --rpm-rpmbuild-define for passing a --define flag to rpmbuild
    (via Naresh V)
  - PHP pear source support (fpm -s pear ...) (via Andrew Gaffney)

0.3.10 (Oct 10, 2011)
  - Allow taking a list of files/inputs on stdin with '-' or with the --inputs
    flag. (Matt Patterson)
  - (python) pass -U to easy_install (Khalid Goudeaux)
  - (debian) quote paths in md5sum calls (Matt Patterson)
  - (debian) quiet stderr from dpkg --print-architecture

0.3.9 (Sep 8, 2011)
  - Fix bug in 'dir' source that breaks full paths
  - Added a bunch of tests (yaay)

0.3.8 and earlier: I have not kept this file up to date very well... Sorry :(

0.2.29 (May 20, 2011)
  - Add 'tar' source support. Useful for binary releases to repackage as rpms
    and debs. Example:
      fpm -s tar -t rpm -n firefox -v 4.0.1 \
        --prefix /opt/firefox/4.0.1 firefox-4.0.1.tar.bz2

0.2.28 (May 18, 2011)
  - Use --replaces as "Obsoletes" in rpms.

0.2.27 (May 18, 2011)
  - If present, DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables will be used as
    the default maintainer. Previously the default was simply <$user@$hostname>
    https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/37
  - Add '--replaces' flag for specifying packages replaced by the one you are
    building. This only functions in .deb packages now until I find a suitable
    synonym in RPM.
  - Add --python-bin and --python-easyinstall flags. This lets you choose specific
    python and easy_install tools to use when building. Default is simply
    'python' and 'easy_install' respectively.
  - Add support for ~/.fpmrc - The format of this file is the same as the flags.
    One flag per line. https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/38
    Example:
      --python-bin=/usr/bin/python2.7
      --python-easyinstall=/usr/bin/easy_install2.7

0.2.26 and earlier
  No changelist tracked. My bad, yo.

0.2.29 (May 20, 2011)
  - Add 'tar' source support. Useful for binary releases to repackage as rpms
    and debs. Example:
      fpm -s tar -t rpm -n firefox -v 4.0.1 \
        --prefix /opt/firefox/4.0.1 firefox-4.0.1.tar.bz2

0.2.28 (May 18, 2011)
  - Use --replaces as "Obsoletes" in rpms.

0.2.27 (May 18, 2011)
  - If present, DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables will be used as
    the default maintainer. Previously the default was simply <$user@$hostname>
    https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/37
  - Add '--replaces' flag for specifying packages replaced by the one you are
    building. This only functions in .deb packages now until I find a suitable
    synonym in RPM.
  - Add --python-bin and --python-easyinstall flags. This lets you choose specific
    python and easy_install tools to use when building. Default is simply
    'python' and 'easy_install' respectively.
  - Add support for ~/.fpmrc - The format of this file is the same as the flags.
    One flag per line. https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/38
    Example:
      --python-bin=/usr/bin/python2.7
      --python-easyinstall=/usr/bin/easy_install2.7

0.4.40 (July 12, 2013)
  - dir: supports mapping one path to another.
    You set mappings by using 'source=destination' syntax. For example:
    % fpm -s dir -t deb -n example /home/jls/.zshrc=/etc/skel/
    The key above is the '=' symbol. The result of the above will be a package
    containing only /etc/skel/.zshrc
    For more, see https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki/Source:-dir#mapping
  - python: the default scripts location is now chosen by python itself. The
    previous default was "/usr/bin" and was not a good default. (#480)

  - Now supports npm, the node package manager. For example: 
    'fpm -s npm -t deb express'

0.4.32 (April 9, 2013)
  - COMPATIBILITY WARNING: rpm: The default epoch is now nothing because this
    aligns more closely with typical rpm packages in the real world. This
    decision was reached in #381. If you need the previous behavior, you
    must now specify '--epoch 1' (#388, patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - python: new flag --python-obey-requirements-txt which makes a
    requirements.txt file from the python package used for the package
    dependencies instead of the usual setup.py dependencies. The default
    behavior without this flag is to respect setup.py. (#384)
  - deb: new flag --deb-shlibs to specify the content of the 'shlibs' file
    in the debian package (#405, patch by Aman Gupta)

    that would normally be added by gem, python, deb, and rpms input packages.
    (#386, #374; patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - gem: Use 'gem' command to download gems and read gem package information.
    (#389, #394, #378, #233; patches by Pranay Kanwar and Chris Roberts)
  - rpm: dashes are now replaced with underscores in rpm version strings
    (#395, #393, #399;  patches by Jeff Terrace and Richard Guest)
  - python: Only use the first line of a license; some python packages (like
    'requests') embed their full license copy into the license field. For
    the sake of sanity and function with most packaging systems, fpm only
    uses the first line of that license.
  - rpm: Add new 'none' option to --rpm-compression to disable compression
    entirely. (#398, patch by Richard Guest)
  - deb: Make dependencies using the '!=' operator represented as "Breaks"
    in the deb package (previously used "Conflicts"). (#400)
  - deb: Add md5sums to the debian packages which improves correctness
    of the package. (#403, #401; patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - rpm: Convert all '!=' dependency operators to 'Conflicts'. Previously,
    this only applied to packages converting from python to rpm. 
    (#404, #396; patch by Pranay Kanwar)

0.4.31 (March 21, 2013)
  - rpm: new flag --rpm-use-file-permissions which try to create an rpm
    that has file ownership/modes that exactly mirror how they are on 
    the filesystem at package time. (#377, patch by Paul Rhodes)
  - general: remove empty directories only when they match the exclude 
    pattern (#323, patch by Pranay Kanwar)

0.4.30 (March 21, 2013)
  - Solaris: --solaris-user and --solaris-group flags to specify
    the owner of files in a package. (#342, patch by Derek Olsen)
  - rpm: (bug fix) epoch of 0 is permitted now (#343, patch by Ben Hughes)
  - pear: add flags --pear-bin-dir --pear-php-bin --pear-php-dir (#358, patch
    by Zsolt Takács)
  - New 'source' type: empty. Allows you to create packages without any files
    in them (sometimes called 'meta packages'). Useful when you want to have
    one package be simply dependencies or when you want to spoof a package
    you don't want installed, etc. (#359, 349; patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - solaris: Add --solaris-user and --solaris-group flags (#342, Patch by Derek
    Olsen)
  - gem: new flag --env-shebang; default true (disable with --no-env-shebang).
    Lets you disable #! (shebang) mangling done by gem installation. (#363,
    patch by Grier Johnson)
  - deb: fix bug on changelog handling (#376, patch by mbakke)
  - rpm: fix --rpm-rpmbuild-define (#383, patch by Eric Merritt)

    rtucker-mozilla)
  - deb: Add --deb-field for setting a custom field in the control file.
    For more information on this setting, see section 5.7 "User-defined fields"
    of the debian policy manual: 
    http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s5.7
  - deb: Add --deb-recommends and --deb-suggests (#285, #310; patch by Pranay
    Kanwar)

    package types. (#300, patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - deb: Multiple "provides" are now supported. (#301, patch by Pranay Kanwar)
  - rpm: Added --rpm-os flag to set the OS target for the rpm. This lets you build 
    rpms for linux on OS X and other platforms (with --rpm-os linux). (#309)
  - rpm: Avoid platform-dependent commands in the %install phase (#309, fixes
    'cp -d' on OSX)

  - Don't require extra parameters if you use --inputs (#278, #297; Patch by
    Pranay Kanwar)

  - python: supports pip now. Use '--python-pip path/to/pip' to have fpm use
    it instead of easy_install.
  - solaris: package building works again (#216, #299, patch by Pierre-Yves
    Ritschard)

0.4.23 (November 26, 2012)
  - The --directories flag is now recursive when the output package is rpm.
    This makes all directories under a given path as owned by the package
    so they'll be removed when the package is uninstalled (#245, #293, #294,
    patch by Justin Ellison)
  - Add fpm version info to '--help' output (#281)
  - gem to rpm: Use 'rubygem(gemname)' for dependencies (#284, patch by

    (#288, patch by Andrew Bunday)

0.4.21 (November 8, 2012)

  - Escape '%' characters in file names (#266, #222. Patch by John Wittkoski)

0.4.18 (September 25, 2012)
  - Fix regression in rpm building where the epoch in was missing in the rpm,
    but prior fpm versions defaulted it to 1. This caused rpms built with newer
    fpms to appear "older" than older rpms. Tests added to ensure this regression
    is caught prior to future releases! (Reported by eliklein)

0.4.17 (September 12, 2012)
  - Remove accidental JSON warning when using '-s python'

0.4.16 (September 6, 2012)
  - Fix compatibility with Ruby 1.8.7 (broken in 0.4.15)

0.4.15 (September 6, 2012)
  - pear: support custom channels with --pear-channel <channel> (#207)
    Example: fpm -s pear -t deb --pear-channel pear.drush.org drush
  - permit literal '\n' in --description, fpm will replace with a newline
    character. Example: fpm --description "line one\nline two" (#251)
  - improve error messaging when trying to output a package to a directory that
    doesn't exist (#244)
  - deb: convert '>' and '<' dependency operators to the correct '>>' and '<<'
    debian version operators (#250, patch by Thomas Meson).
  - deb: add --deb-priority flag (#232) for setting the debian 'priority'
    value for your package.
  - add --template-value. Used to expose arbitrary values to script templates.
    If you do --template-value hello=world, in your template you can do
    <%= hello %> to get 'world' to show up in your maintainer scripts.
  - python: add --python-install-data flag to set the --install-data option to
    setup.py (#255, patch by Thomas Meson)
  - Reject bad dependency flags (ones containing commas) and offer alternative.
    (#257)
  - Try to copy a file if hardlinking fails with permission problems (#253, 
    patch by Jacek Lach)
  - Make --exclude, if a directory, include itself and any children, recursive.
    (#248)

0.4.14 (August 24, 2012)
  - rpm: Replace newlines with space in any license setting. (#252)

0.4.13 (August 14, 2012)
  - Make --exclude accept path prefixes as well. If you have a files in
    'usr/share/man' in your package, you can now exclude all of a subdir
    by doing '--exclude usr/share/man'

0.4.12 (August 10, 2012)
  - Fix a major bug introduced in 0.4.11 that caused all deb packages to
    contain empty maintainer scripts if not otherwise specified, which made
    apt/dpkg quite unhappy

0.4.11 (August 7, 2012)
  - Fix some symlink handling to prevent links from being followed during
    cleanup (#228, patch by sbuss)
  - rpm: 'vendor' in rpm spec is now omitted if empty or nil. This fixes a bug
    where rpmbuild fails due to empty 'Vendor' tag if you convert rpm to rpm.
  - internal: remove empty directories marked by --exclude (#205, patch by
    jimbrowne)
  - dir: don't try to set utime on symlinks (#234, #240, patch by ctgswallow)
  - rpm: relocatable rpms now supported when using the '--prefix' flag.
    Example: fpm -s dir -t rpm --prefix /usr/local -n example /etc/motd 
    (patch by jkoppe)
  - deb: --deb-compression flag: Support different compression methods. 
    Default continues to be gzip.
  - new flag: --template-scripts. This lets you write script templates for
    --after-install, etc. Templates are ERB, so you can do things like 
    '<%= name %>' to get the package name in the script, etc.
  - warn on command invocations that appear to have stray flags to try and
    help users who have complex command lines that are failling.

0.4.10 (May 25, 2012)

    patch by Sven Fischer)
  - Allow setting default user/group for files in rpm packages (#208, patch by
    Jason Rogers). Note: This adds --user and --group flags to effect this.
    These flags may go away in the future, but if they do, they will be

    /usr, etc.
  - make --deb-custom-control to work again (Tor Arne Vestbø)
  - Add --rpm-digest flag to allow selection of the rpm 'file name' digest
    algorithm. Default is 'md5' since it works on the most rpm systems.
  - Reimplement old behavior assuming "." as the input when using '-s dir' and
    also setting -C (#187)
  - Set BuildRoot on rpm to work around an rpmbuild bug(?) on CentOS 5 (#191)

  - Improve default values of iteration and epoch (#190)
  - Make FPM::Package#files list only 'leaf' nodes (files, empty directories,
    symlinks, etc).

0.4.3 (March 21, 2012)
  - Fix bug in python packaging when invoked with a relative path to a setup.py
    (Reported by Thomas Meson, https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/pull/180)

0.4.2 (March 21, 2012)
  - Set default temporary directory to /tmp 
    (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/174)
  - Improve symlink handling (patch by Aleix Conchillo Flaqué, pull/177))
  - Python package support changes (thanks to input by Luke Macken):
    * New flag: --python-install-bin. Sets the location for python package
      scripts (default: /usr/bin)
    * New flag: --python-install-lib. Sets the location for the python
      package to install libs to, default varies by system. Usually something
      like /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages.
    * Fix up --prefix support
    * Improve staged package installation

0.4.1 (March 19, 2012)
  - Fix fpm so it works in ruby 1.8 again.
    Tests run, and passing:
      rvm 1.8.7,1.9.2,1.9.3 do bundle exec rspec

0.4.0 (March 18, 2012)
  - Complete rewrite of pretty much everything.
    * Otherwise, the 'fpm' command functionality should be the same
    * Please let me know if something broke!
  - Now has an API (see examples/api directory)
  - Also has a proper test suite
  - Updated the rpm spec generator to disable all the ways I've found rpmbuild
    to molest packages. This means that fpm-generated rpms will no longer
    strip libraries, move files around, randomly mutate jar files, etc.
  - Add --license and --vendor settings (via Pieter Loubser)
  - python support: try to name python packages sanely. Some pypi packages
    are literally called 'python-foo' so make sure we generate packages named
    'python-foo' and not 'python-python-foo' (via Thomas Meson)
  - rpm support: Add --rpm-rpmbuild-define for passing a --define flag to rpmbuild
    (via Naresh V)
  - PHP pear source support (fpm -s pear ...) (via Andrew Gaffney)

0.3.10 (Oct 10, 2011)

  - (debian) quiet stderr from dpkg --print-architecture

0.3.9 (Sep 8, 2011)
  - Fix bug in 'dir' source that breaks full paths
  - Added a bunch of tests (yaay)

0.3.8 and earlier: I have not kept this file up to date very well... Sorry :(

0.2.29 (May 20, 2011)
  - Add 'tar' source support. Useful for binary releases to repackage as rpms
    and debs. Example:
      fpm -s tar -t rpm -n firefox -v 4.0.1 \
        --prefix /opt/firefox/4.0.1 firefox-4.0.1.tar.bz2

0.2.28 (May 18, 2011)
  - Use --replaces as "Obsoletes" in rpms.

0.2.27 (May 18, 2011)
  - If present, DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables will be used as
    the default maintainer. Previously the default was simply <$user@$hostname>
    https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/37
  - Add '--replaces' flag for specifying packages replaced by the one you are
    building. This only functions in .deb packages now until I find a suitable
    synonym in RPM.
  - Add --python-bin and --python-easyinstall flags. This lets you choose specific
    python and easy_install tools to use when building. Default is simply
    'python' and 'easy_install' respectively.
  - Add support for ~/.fpmrc - The format of this file is the same as the flags.
    One flag per line. https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/38

      --python-bin=/usr/bin/python2.7
      --python-easyinstall=/usr/bin/easy_install2.7

0.2.26 and earlier
  No changelist tracked. My bad, yo.
